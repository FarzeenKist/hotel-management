Most Important: Improving the Canister
Memory Management:

Problem: The current code uses thread-local storage for managing memory, IDs, and storage for rooms, reservations, and guests. However, it lacks proper error handling and may panic in case of failures.
Suggestion: Implement proper error handling for memory allocation and other operations. Use Result to handle errors, and consider logging or providing meaningful error messages.
ID Generation:

Problem: The generate_new_id function could be prone to race conditions in a distributed environment.
Suggestion: Consider using a more robust approach for generating unique IDs, such as using a combination of timestamps and a unique node identifier.
Storage Size Limit:

Problem: The BoundedStorable trait is implemented with a constant MAX_SIZE, but it is not enforced in the storage.
Suggestion: Implement checks in CRUD operations to ensure that the serialized size of the data does not exceed the specified MAX_SIZE.
Error Handling:

Problem: The error types lack sufficient information for debugging or logging.
Suggestion: Enhance error types to include more details or context to aid in debugging or logging.
Important: Technical Problems in Code
Redundant Cloning:

Problem: The Clone trait is derived for structs (e.g., Room, Reservation, Guest), leading to redundant cloning in certain scenarios.
Suggestion: Avoid unnecessary cloning by using references or borrowing where possible, especially in functions that do not require ownership.
Query Function Naming:

Problem: Naming of query functions could be more consistent for clarity.
Suggestion: Consider using a consistent naming convention for query functions, such as query_get_room instead of get_room.
Thread-Local Storage:

Problem: The heavy reliance on thread-local storage might not be the most efficient or scalable solution, especially in a distributed environment.
Suggestion: Evaluate alternatives such as using persistent storage or leveraging IC state to achieve better scalability.
Not Important: Content Improvement
Documentation:
Note: The code lacks inline comments and documentation, which might make it challenging for others to understand the implementation.
Suggestion: Add inline comments to explain complex logic, and consider providing high-level documentation for the canister's purpose, data structures, and usage.
